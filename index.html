              A microphone, colloquially called a mic (/maɪk/),[1] or mike,[a]
              is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal.
              Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones,
              hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public
              events, motion picture production, live and recorded audio
              engineering, sound recording, two-way radios, megaphones, and
              radio and television broadcasting. They are also used in computers
              and other electronic devices, such as mobile phones, for recording
              sounds, speech recognition, VoIP, and other purposes, such as
              ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors.

            <h2>Acoustic guitar</h2>
            <p>
              An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the string family.
              When a string is plucked, its vibration is transmitted from the
              bridge, resonating throughout the top of the guitar. It is also
              transmitted to the side and back of the instrument, resonating
              through the air in the body, and producing sound from the sound
              hole.[1] While the original, general term for this stringed
              instrument is guitar, the retronym 'acoustic guitar' – often used
              to indicate the steel stringed model – distinguishes it from an
              electric guitar, which relies on electronic amplification.
              Typically, a guitar's body is a sound box, of which the top side
              serves as a sound board that enhances the vibration sounds of the
              strings. In standard tuning the guitar's six strings[2] are tuned
              (low to high)
